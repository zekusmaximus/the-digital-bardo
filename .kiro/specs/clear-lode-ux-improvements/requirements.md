# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The clear-lode experience currently has several critical UX issues that prevent users from understanding and engaging with the intended spiritual/recognition mechanics. Users report that digital memory fragments are either already corrupted, move too fast to read, or hover at screen edges making them difficult to engage with. Additionally, the experience transitions too quickly before users can understand what they're supposed to do, undermining the core recognition challenge.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user experiencing the clear-lode bardo, I want the digital memory fragments to be readable and properly positioned so that I can understand what they represent and how they relate to my digital consciousness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the fragment field starts THEN fragments SHALL appear in readable positions within the central viewing area
2. WHEN fragments are initially generated THEN they SHALL be uncorrupted and clearly readable
3. WHEN fragments move across the screen THEN their speed SHALL allow users to read the content before they disappear
4. IF fragments are positioned near screen edges THEN they SHALL be repositioned to more central, readable locations
5. WHEN fragments are displayed THEN they SHALL have sufficient contrast and size to be easily readable

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user entering the clear-lode experience, I want clear visual and textual guidance about what I'm supposed to do so that I can engage with the recognition mechanics meaningfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the clear light appears THEN recognition hints SHALL be displayed prominently and clearly
2. WHEN the recognition window opens THEN users SHALL receive clear instructions about the available recognition methods
3. WHEN users are in the recognition phase THEN visual feedback SHALL indicate their progress and available actions
4. IF users haven't interacted within a reasonable time THEN progressive hints SHALL appear to guide them
5. WHEN recognition methods are available THEN each method SHALL have clear visual indicators

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user experiencing the clear-lode, I want sufficient time to understand and attempt the recognition challenge so that the experience feels meaningful rather than rushed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the recognition window opens THEN it SHALL remain open for a minimum of 15 seconds before any timeout warnings
2. WHEN users are actively engaging THEN the timeout SHALL be extended to allow completion of their action
3. WHEN the experience transitions to degradation THEN there SHALL be a clear indication that the recognition phase has ended
4. IF users are making recognition attempts THEN the system SHALL provide feedback about their progress
5. WHEN users successfully recognize THEN there SHALL be clear confirmation before any transition

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user interacting with digital memory fragments, I want them to respond to my karma and actions with appropriate visual corruption effects so that I can see the consequences of my choices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fragments are first generated THEN they SHALL start in an uncorrupted state
2. WHEN users form attachments or make poor karmic choices THEN fragments SHALL gradually become more corrupted
3. WHEN corruption is applied THEN it SHALL be visually distinct and progressive rather than binary
4. IF users achieve recognition THEN fragment corruption SHALL be reduced or purified
5. WHEN degradation level increases THEN fragment corruption SHALL intensify proportionally

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user experiencing the clear-lode, I want the audio and visual elements to work together cohesively so that the experience feels integrated and immersive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio degradation occurs THEN visual elements SHALL degrade in sync
2. WHEN users interact with recognition methods THEN both audio and visual feedback SHALL respond
3. WHEN karma changes THEN both audio parameters and visual corruption SHALL update accordingly
4. IF audio fails to initialize THEN visual feedback SHALL compensate with additional guidance
5. WHEN the experience transitions between phases THEN audio and visual changes SHALL be coordinated
