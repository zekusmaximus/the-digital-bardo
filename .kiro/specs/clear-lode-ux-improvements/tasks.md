# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create fragment positioning system for readable placement

  - Implement FragmentPositionManager class with safe zone calculations
  - Add readability scoring system based on position and speed
  - Create automatic repositioning for edge-drifting fragments
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 1.5_

- [x] 2. Implement progressive fragment corruption system

  - Modify fragment generation to start fragments in clean, uncorrupted state
  - Create CorruptionProgression class that applies corruption over time based on karma
  - Implement visual corruption effects that are progressive rather than binary
  - Add corruption purification effects for successful recognition
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 3. Add speed control system for fragment readability

  - Implement speed calculation based on fragment content length
  - Add maximum speed limits to ensure fragments remain readable
  - Create smooth speed transitions to avoid jarring movement changes
  - _Requirements: 1.3_

- [x] 4. Create recognition guidance and hint system

  - Implement RecognitionGuideController with progressive hint display
  - Add clear visual instructions for each recognition method (center click, keywords, spacebar hold)
  - Create visual feedback system for recognition attempts and progress
  - Add recognition method indicators that appear when window opens
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5_

- [x] 5. Extend recognition timing and add timeout warnings


  - Increase minimum recognition window duration to 15 seconds
  - Implement timeout warning system that alerts users before window closes
  - Add time extension logic for users actively attempting recognition
  - Create clear transition indicators when recognition phase ends
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Implement synchronized audio-visual degradation

  - Enhance existing degradation system to coordinate audio and visual corruption
  - Add karma-responsive visual updates that sync with audio parameter changes
  - Implement recognition feedback that affects both audio and visual elements
  - Create fallback visual guidance when audio initialization fails
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 7. Add user progress feedback and confirmation systems

  - Implement visual progress indicators for spacebar hold recognition method
  - Add confirmation animations and feedback for successful recognition
  - Create clear feedback for failed recognition attempts
  - Add visual indicators when users are making progress toward recognition
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 3.4_

- [ ] 8. Integrate new systems with existing clear-lode orchestrator

  - Update ClearLodeOrchestrator to initialize new positioning and guidance systems
  - Modify event handling to support new recognition feedback and timing systems
  - Ensure proper cleanup and resource management for new components
  - Test integration with existing karma engine and consciousness state management
  - _Requirements: All requirements integration_

- [ ] 9. Add performance optimization for enhanced UX features

  - Implement fragment pooling to reduce garbage collection from repositioning
  - Optimize corruption effects to maintain smooth performance
  - Add performance monitoring for new visual feedback systems
  - Ensure new features work across different performance tiers
  - _Requirements: Performance considerations from design_

- [ ] 10. Create comprehensive testing for UX improvements
  - Write unit tests for FragmentPositionManager readability calculations
  - Add integration tests for recognition timing and guidance systems
  - Create visual regression tests for corruption progression effects
  - Test audio-visual synchronization across different scenarios
  - _Requirements: Testing validation for all requirements_
