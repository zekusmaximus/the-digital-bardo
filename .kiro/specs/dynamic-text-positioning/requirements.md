# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the clear-lode bardo experience by improving the dynamic positioning of text fragments. Currently, text tends to cluster around the screen edges, creating an unbalanced visual experience. The enhancement will distribute text more evenly across the entire screen space, including the center area, creating a more immersive and visually engaging experience that better represents the fluid nature of consciousness exploration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user experiencing the clear-lode bardo, I want text fragments to move fluidly across the entire screen space, so that I feel immersed in a dynamic field of consciousness rather than observing text confined to screen edges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text fragments are generated THEN the system SHALL position them across the full screen area including center regions
2. WHEN text fragments move THEN they SHALL follow paths that traverse through middle screen areas as well as edges
3. WHEN multiple text fragments are active THEN they SHALL be distributed evenly across the available screen space
4. IF text fragments are clustering in edge areas THEN the system SHALL apply distribution algorithms to spread them toward center regions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the clear-lode experience, I want the text movement to feel natural and organic, so that the enhanced positioning doesn't feel mechanical or jarring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text fragments change position THEN transitions SHALL use smooth animations consistent with existing clear-lode aesthetics
2. WHEN text moves through center areas THEN movement SHALL maintain the existing karma-influenced behavior patterns
3. WHEN fragments traverse different screen regions THEN they SHALL respect existing audio-visual synchronization
4. IF performance is impacted by enhanced positioning THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing performance tier adaptations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with different screen sizes and orientations, I want the improved text positioning to work consistently across my device, so that the experience remains engaging regardless of my viewport.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the viewport size changes THEN text distribution SHALL recalculate to utilize the full available space
2. WHEN on mobile devices THEN center-area text positioning SHALL account for touch interaction zones
3. WHEN in different orientations THEN text SHALL redistribute appropriately for portrait and landscape modes
4. IF screen dimensions are very small THEN the system SHALL gracefully adapt positioning while maintaining readability
