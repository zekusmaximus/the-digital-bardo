# Product Overview

"The Digital Bardo" is an interactive web-based exploration of consciousness, life, and the afterlife, inspired by the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Created by speculative fiction author Jeffrey A. Zyjeski, it translates the liminal states of the bardo into digital experiences.

## Core Concept
The project explores techno-spiritual themes through interactive "bardo" states - unique, self-contained experiences that guide users through a digital reincarnation journey. Each bardo represents different facets of existence, from sensory chaos to introspective journeys.

## Guiding Principle
**"The Medium is the Metaphysics"** - Every technical choice must serve the narrative. The code is not merely functional but a storytelling medium where user interactions have karmic consequences reflected in the experience.

## Key Features
- Interactive "Bardo" States with unique experiences
- Karmic Engine that tracks user interactions and influences the journey
- Dynamic audio using Web Audio API with karma-driven degradation
- Performance-optimized with adaptive monitoring and fragment optimization
- Security measures integrated as narrative elements (consciousness purification)

## Target Audience
Users interested in interactive art, consciousness exploration, and immersive web experiences. The project assumes modern browser capabilities but includes graceful degradation.
