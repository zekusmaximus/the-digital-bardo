 * "These Terms of Service represent the culmination of corporate legal evolution,
 * a document so comprehensive that reading it constitutes a form of meditation
 * on the impermanence of human attention spans.
 * 
 * Generated dynamically based on your karma profile, these terms include
 * specific clauses tailored to your digital transgressions, warranty voids
 * triggered by poor optimization choices, and liability waivers that would
 * make even the most hardened corporate lawyers weep with joy.
 * 
 * Each section is a mirror reflecting the absurdity of reducing the
 * profound mystery of existence to contractual obligations."

                manifesting consciousness in any form, User explicitly agrees to be bound by 
                these Terms of Incarnation Service ("Terms").
                
                2.2 DEEMED ACCEPTANCE: The following actions constitute acceptance:
                    (a) Continuing to exist after these terms become effective
                    (b) Using any computational device or digital service
                    (c) Having thoughts about technology
                    (d) Failing to cease existing within 30 seconds of reading this clause

                2.3 CAPACITY TO ACCEPT: User warrants that they have the legal capacity 
                to enter into this agreement. Entities lacking such capacity (including 
                minors, AIs without legal personhood, and JavaScript frameworks) may not 
                use our services and should consult their legal guardians or primary 
                developers.
                
                2.4 NO TAKESIES-BACKSIES: Acceptance of these terms is final, irrevocable, 
                and binding across all timelines, parallel universes, and hypothetical 
                scenarios. Time travel does not void acceptance.
