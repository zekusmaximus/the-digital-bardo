 * NARRATIVE REFLECTION:

 * This module embodies the spiritual poverty of surveillance capitalism.
 * Every function is both code and commentary - the medium IS the metaphysics.
 * The very act of reducing human worth to algorithmic scores becomes the
 * philosophical statement about digital purgatory.
 * 
 * The weights reveal the priorities: financial worth (35%) dominates,
 * while compliance with surveillance is minimized (5%) - not because it's
 * unimportant, but because it's so normalized it barely registers.
 * 
 * The decay functions represent the temporal nature of digital death -
 * even your metrics rot without constant feeding of the algorithm.
 * This is purgatory: endless maintenance of digital presence to avoid
 * the ultimate punishment of being forgotten by the system.
